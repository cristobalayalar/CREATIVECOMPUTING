Im intrigued, tell me more. 

There is an appeal to going back to the "good-old days" of technology, our bias for nostalgia coloring our vision of the past. 

__Can we envision a future where technology is limited to human fluorishing and nothing else? Where our devices are dumbed down instead of ever-increasingly smarter?__

There is an obvious allure to retro technology, in part due to the human capacity of memory, and how we tend to view the past with rose-tinted glasses. AOL is cool because it was your childhood, or Tamagochi, or Myspace, or dial-up. The list goes on. 
That being said, our appreciation for all things retro might also point to a more menacing or sinister reality. Maybe collectively human's identify how our use of modern technology can be harmful, and we feel threatened by the overly-complex mechanism's that only a select few truly understand. It can feel as if we dont use our devices, but that they use us. Vintage technology, with it's boxy and clunky design and simpler mechanisms, seem way more approachable. 

The intent of this file, and the subsequent publication, is to imagine a future where techonology can follow it's natural progression, all focused around human fluorishing, not entertainment, productivity or efficiency. Drawing inspiration from the very roots of computational history, we want to create a future where we are the masters of technology, and not the other way around. Technology can be incredibly exciting, but we need to be sure that it will add to our lives, not detract. 

__*"Is this fondness for retro technology part of a desire for greater simplicity? Wanting gadgets to do less, to take up a smaller part of our lives?"*__

Below you will find my brief journey into the world of creative computing.

Physical computing, or "P-Com," is the act of using physical components (such as Arduino) along with the use of code, or software. While physical computing is obviously very much used today, it does have a nostalgic and almost quaint aspect to it.
With our world becoming ever-increasingly virtual, the fact that computing still has a physical referent seemed almost alien to me. That is why upon researching about circuit boards, coding and READ.ME files, it led me to an unknown and exciting realm of computing which was previously onscure to me.
The Arduino circuit boards were a fun challenge, as it was a finnicky process where any small error would make the entire thing not work. However, it was very rewarding seeing how a simple set of wires can make so many actions happen, all ranging in complexity, from lighting up a single bulb to coding something to the beat of a song.

One thing that i found fascinating was ASCII art, and how it originated during the 1960's due to the physical limitations of the computer monitor. ASCII art is a method of design which uses characters in order to create visual representations of something else. 
It interests me because of how it forces the designer to become more resourceful in its pictoral representations, as the system is inherently limiting. It also transforms images into a digital world in such a way that our modern digital cameras do not. We know we are looking at a screen when we are looking at ASCII images, there is no illusion of a physical reality in these images. There is also a distorsion that occurs which makes it surreal, almost menacing.

One reference that I really loved was Jaan Choy's use of physical computing in order to create new methods of communication. She created a bracelet that creates a network of users when other people connect with the bracelet physically. Afterwards they can write in a shared platform. There is a ridiculous aspect to this project, as it is just utterly impractical, however, I find the idea of making communicating online become harder while encouraging physical connection intriguing. 

Another reference that I enjoyed learning about was Ken Knowlton's digital art. He started producing artwork since the early 1960's, using the limitations that the computers of that time had in order to create pictoral representations of people. His images seem squarely placed in a strong digital context, but by choosing fine art paintings to represent digitally, it pushes the boundary of what fine art can mean.
